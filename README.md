# SIIM-ISIC-Melanoma-Classification
The task is a kaggle competition available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification/overview) - It is an image classification problem.
I convert images and meta data to *TFRecords* and train the CNN models, with *EfficientNets* as the backbone of the models.


Note: **The model ranks 215 on the leaderboard in bronze medal position.**
